### My Journey at Everfund

In June 2023, I joined Everfund as a Full-Stack Engineer, embarking on a journey that blended innovation, user-centric design, and technical excellence. Over the next year and a half, I worked on projects that challenged me and deepened my expertise.

### Migrating JavaScript Frameworks

One of my first big projects I was involved in was migrating the dashboard from Redwood to Next.js. This was no small feat, but ensuring minimal downtime and seamless integration was key to the project's success. The migration not only stabilized the product but also paved the way for future scalability. Additionally, the project simplified our tech stack as we were already using Next.js for our donation platform.

### Elevating User Experience

From concept to implementation, I led UI/UX efforts, developing a scalable design system in Figma. By ensuring consistency and accessibility across all components, I delivered intuitive front-end features that improved user satisfaction.

### Exploring Machine Learning

I explored the potential of predictive machine learning to optimize the suggested donation amounts a donor might see. By focusing on feature engineering and model evaluation, I presented actionable insights that shaped our approach to data-driven features. While the suggested amounts ML was never implemented, it was an interesting area to explore both the how it would be implemented as well as the ethical questions around the use of ML in the nonprofit-area.

### Tailoring the Donation Experience for Nonprofits

Creating a domain white-labeling system was a project I was proud of. I designed a solution that allowed customers to use their branded domains to point to our hosted donation portal website, overcoming technical challenges like DNS configuration & Stripe Domain Verification. This project strengthened brand alignment for our clients and enhanced user trust.

Additionally, I designed & developed a customizable email system, this allowed for donation-related emails such as a receipt to be branded towards the nonprofit the donation was for, instead of just a generic Everfund-styled receipt. This project also brought forward key internal tools like a dashboard to track the emails we were sending.

### Summary

Working at Everfund was an amazing experience where I learned and grew a lot as a software engineer. I tackled challenging projects, like simplifying technical processes, designing user-friendly experiences, and exploring new technologies, all while focusing on delivering value for the company and the nonprofits using Everfund.

I am proud of the work I accomplished and I think in the future I want to continue to build technology that makes a difference.
