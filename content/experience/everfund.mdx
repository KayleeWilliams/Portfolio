### Framework Migration

Migrated the main dashboard from RedwoodJS to Next.js with minimal downtime, simplifying the stack since the donation platform already ran on Next.js.

### White-Labeled Donations

Built a domain white-labeling system so nonprofits could serve our hosted donation portal on their own branded domains. Involved DNS configuration, Stripe domain verification, and a customizable email system for branded donation receipts.

### Design System

Led UI/UX from Figma through to implementation. Built a component design system focused on consistency and accessibility across the product.

### ML Exploration

Explored predictive ML for optimizing suggested donation amounts. The model never shipped, but the work surfaced interesting ethical questions around using ML in the nonprofit space.
