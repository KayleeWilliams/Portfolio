### Building Consent Infrastructure

Consent provides the underlying infrastructure for compliant consent management - a mix of open-source and deterministic systems capable of handling jurisdiction, storage, and execution across all operational layers.

As founding engineer, I'm building the full stack: from the high-performance c15t cookie banner (minimal bundle, zero bloat) to the hosted platform that makes c15t instances compliant at scale.

More details coming as we ship...
