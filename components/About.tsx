        I’m a passionate software engineer who loves creating impactful web and
        mobile applications that seamlessly blend innovative technology with
        practical business requirements. When I’m not engrossed in coding, you
        can find me captivated by storytelling through binge-watching shows like
        Andor or Arcane, indulging in baking, or immersing myself in gaming. I’m
        always on the lookout for opportunities to combine my creative side with
        problem-solving, striving to continuously learn and expand my knowledge.
